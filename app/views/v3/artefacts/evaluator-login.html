        stage of the procurement. You will be able to:</p>

        <li>Complete the declaration of interest form </li>
        <li>Watch the evaluation training video </li>

      <p class="govuk-body">Bids must be evaluated using the pre-populated
        evaluation sheet with scores allocated using the scoring methodology and
        reasoning shared. Bids must be evaluated independently of each other and
        other evaluators.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Insufficient justification for scores will result in
        evaluations being returned, which could delay the procurement.</p>
